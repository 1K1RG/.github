# ðŸŒ¾ 1K1 Rice Genome Project â€“ Philippines

**A national genomics initiative to sequence and analyze 1,001 traditional Philippine rice varieties to support breeding, food security, and sustainable agriculture.**

---

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

The **1K Rice Genome Project â€“ Philippines** is led by the **Philippine Genome Center (PGC)** in partnership with **UP Los BaÃ±os**, **DA-PhilRice**, and the **International Rice Research Institute (IRRI)**. Funded by **DOST-PCAARRD**, this project aims to uncover the genetic diversity of local rice landraces and apply genomic data to accelerate crop improvement programs.

### ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Sequence and analyze 1,001 Philippine rice accessions
- Identify genes linked to yield, climate resilience, and nutritional traits
- Develop a reference genome for the aromatic rice variety *Dinorado*
- Build tools and databases for breeders and researchers
- Support national food security through genomics-informed breeding
